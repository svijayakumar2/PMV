Each of these triangles is an isosceles right triangle with legs equal to the radius of the circle.\n\nThe area of one such right-angled triangle can be calculated as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Area of one triangle} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{leg}_1 \\times \\text{leg}_2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 4 \\times 4 = 8\n\\]\n\nSince there are four such triangles, the total area of the four triangles is:\n\\[\n4 \\times 8 = 32\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the area of the quarter-circle that is not shaded. Each quarter-circle has an area equal to one-fourth of the area of the entire circle. The area of the entire circle is:\n\\[\n\\pi \\times (\\text{radius})^2 = \\pi \\times 4^2 = 16\\pi\n\\]\n\nThus, the area of one quarter-circle is:\n\\[\n\\frac{16\\pi}{4} = 4\\pi\n\\]\n\nSince there are two quarter-circles (one for each half of the circle), their combined area is:\n\\[\n2 \\times 4\\pi = 8\\pi\n\\]\n\nThe shaded region is the area of the circle minus the area of the four right-angled triangles plus the area of the two quarter-circles. However, since the area of the four triangles already includes the area of the two quarter-circles, we only need to subtract the area of the four triangles from the area of the circle:\n\\[\n\\text{Area of the shaded region} = 16\\pi - 32\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the area of the shaded region is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{16\\pi - 32}\n\\]",

    "true_solution": "We have to find $\\cos \\left( \\arcsin \\frac{5}{13} \\right)$. We are working with $\\arcsin$, which is related to $\\sin$. So we can start from the fact that:\n\\[ \\arcsin x = \\theta \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\sin \\theta = x \\]\n\nIf we take $x = \\frac{5}{13}$, we have:\n\\[ \\arcsin \\frac{5}{13} = \\theta \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\sin \\theta = \\frac{5}{13} \\]\n\nNext, we want to find $\\cos \\theta$. To do this, we can use the Pythagorean identity:\n\\[ \\sin^2 \\theta + \\cos^2 \\theta = 1 \\]\n\nRearranging this to solve for $\\cos \\theta$:\n\\[ \\cos^2 \\theta = 1 - \\sin^2 \\theta \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\cos \\theta = \\pm \\sqrt{1 - \\sin^2 \\theta} \\]\n\nHowever, we know that $-1 \\le \\cos \\theta \\le 1$. Therefore, we can find $\\cos \\theta$ by taking the positive square root:\n\\[ \\cos \\theta = \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{5}{13}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{25}{169}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{144}{169}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{12}{13}\\right)^2} = \\frac{12}{13} \\]\n\nThe value we found is a positive value for $\\cos \\theta$, which corresponds to an angle in the first quadrant. This matches with the fact that the range of $\\arcsin$ is $\\left[-\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right]$. Therefore, the cosine of the angle that satisfies the equation is the positive value.\n\nSo, $\\cos \\left( \\arcsin \\frac{5}{13} \\right) = \\boxed{\\frac{12}{13}}$",
